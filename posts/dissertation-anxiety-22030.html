								<p>I have entered the final phases of my PhD program, or so I think. I am developing a dissertation proposal, and expect to do the prospectus defense before the end of this year. Even without counting the number of revisions, I estimate that I have changed the broader topics of my dissertation four times already throughout the past two years. But here I am, with my favorite topic among all versions I've ever thought of.
                </p>

                <p>There certainly were, are, and will be frustrations of the propsosal writing process. I got both rejections and acceptances in applications, and praises and concerns from others on my proposal. But at the end of the day, the thoughts that I really like my chapters, that my work will have meanings no matter huge or small, and that I am prepared to do the work I propose to do, make me peaceful and joyful. Here I record some of the fun things I have encountered in this could've been tedius process of proposal writing:
                </p>

                <p>1. The study area of a paper I found was Expo city in Osaka, Japan, where I spent half a year as an exchange student and had an amazing time :) That made me really happy.

									2. A study was conducted in Buenos Aires National Wildlife Reserve, and I thought it must be in Argentina. I felt like traveling the world to see all these different places even just through reading papers. Then I realzied it's in Arizona, where I spent more than two years studying lol. Still, I love Arizona! (just not as exciting because I've never been to Argentina)

									3. My abstract to AGU (1st time to AGU!!) got accepted! Yay! I got to meet all the people I saw in papers! I have to present at 8:40 AM on the next to last day of the conference, but then again my session at AAG started at 7 AM this year on a Saturday, so what to be scared about?!

									4. I learned how to speed up downloading and processing GEDI data from [Vogeler et al. 2023](https://github.com/VogelerLab/GEDI_fusion_Vogeler_2023) (i.e., using aria2 and parallel processing in R for windows)! That saved me so much time and made me so much happier. Thanks to all the people sharing their codes generously and keeping them well-documented!!
